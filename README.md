# secureVoting
This is a smart-contract (Dapp) for the Ethereum blockchain. It is meant for e.g. party conventions and allows various roles (Guest, Member, Replacement Delegate, Delegate, Admin) with different privileges.

It enables management of participants, voting, creating motions or person-elections, seeing results, closing running motions, supporting motions, transfering motion rights, reclaiming voting rights.

This project was started in part for the Master course INSE6615 'Bitcoin and Blockchain Technologies" @Concordia University.
